My ``neovim`` config is documented here, in case I get amnesia (I'm Jason Bourne).

It follows the theory of being a Personal Development Editor, or PDE as coined
by TJ DeVries (also goes by ``teej_dv``).

See :doc:`overview` to get started.

See :ref:`iterate-on-config` on how I safely make changes to the config and
ensure I have a working setup at all times.
